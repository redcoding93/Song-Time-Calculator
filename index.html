# Title: The Really Awesome Super Cool But Not That Specific Song Time Calculator

#Input requirements: 

#1 Name of the song - Done 
#2 Length in seconds - Done 
#3 Number of times the song has been played - Done 

#I declared variables for name, time and plays for each song with no value so that gets.chomp can modify the value of the variable. 

# Creates an empty nest for user input
name = ""
time = ""
plays = 0
four_total = Array.new
songs = ""

#Intro
puts "Hi! Welcome to the song time calculator! please enter your four favorite songs!"

# Loops my code four times (for four different songs)
4.times do
  
# Song Plays
puts "How many times did you play the song?"
plays = gets.to_i

# Song length
puts "How many seconds did you listen to the song?"
time = gets.to_i

#Song Name
puts "What was the song called?"
name = gets.chomp 

# Calculating the listening time for each song by multuplying the song length in seconds by the number of plays.
 length = time * plays 

# Puts the song length inputs into an array.
 four_total << length

# Summary/output for the name, number of plays and length in seconds for each song.

    puts "You have played " + name + " for"
    puts length 
    puts "seconds"
  end
  
   # To find the total listening time for all four songs, I put the time variable inputs into an array, then calculated the sum of the inputs and printed the output of that array (output requirements 2).
  puts "The total play time for these four songs is"
  puts four_total.inject(0){|sum,i| sum + i }
  puts "The song you listened to the most was played for"
  puts four_total.max
  puts "seconds."
  
#Output requirements:
# 1 Listening time for each song - Done 
# 2 Total listening time for all songs -Done 
# 3 Which song has been listened to the longest total amount of time - Done, longest listened but without name.
